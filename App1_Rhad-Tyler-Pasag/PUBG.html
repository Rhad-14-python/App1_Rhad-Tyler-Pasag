        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            In this game, 100 players will be dropped from a plane and can choose where to land.
            The players will then land anywhere with no items and try to survive until only one remains.
            To win, players must find weapons, medicine, attachments, armor, and other items to assist them win.
            Every minute, the map shrinks, causing all players to congregate and fight.
            To win, players must possess stealth, cunning, shooting accuracy, and luck.
