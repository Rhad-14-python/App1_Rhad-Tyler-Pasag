        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            Minecraft is filled with pixelated bricks, creatures, and a devoted community of players. In this game, your primary goal is to survive or construct anything.
            Minecraft is limitless; you can do whatever you want with this game. Minecraft is sometimes referred to as a sandbox game due to the variety of activities available.
            If you're feeling creative, Minecraft allows you to create anything you can think of. However, if you are courageous or adventurous, you can travel the entire globe and confront all bad creatures.
            In this game, blocks can be broken, crafted, placed, changed the landscape, or used to construct various constructions.
