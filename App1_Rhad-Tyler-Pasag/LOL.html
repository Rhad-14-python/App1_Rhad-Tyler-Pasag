        <h2>League of Legends</h2>
        <p>
            Riot Games invented League of Legends, sometimes known as "League" in 2009. This game is about teamwork, strategy, and outplaying opponents.
            Players must work together to shatter the nexus before the opponent team does. League of Legends is a challenging game that requires advanced strategies and fast-paced gameplay.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            Each team has five players, and the main goal is to destroy the enemy's base, referred to as Nexus. 
            Five players then appeared in the map known as the summoner's rift. 
            The map is divided into two sides: red and blue. Each side then has a nexus and two more towers to defend it. 
            Three lanes termed Top lane, Bot lane, and Mid lane, each with three towers, connect the two sides. 
            When the game starts, minions will spawn and march towards their respective lanes.
            Each team then spawns at the fountain, where you can buy things, heal, and respawn. The Fountain is located behind the Nexus.
